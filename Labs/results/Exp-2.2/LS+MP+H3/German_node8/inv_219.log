	200000 states explored in 10.40s, with 911559 rules fired and 146027 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 14.77s, with 1454261 rules fired and 213622 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 20.23s, with 2127682 rules fired and 269714 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 27.62s, with 3020732 rules fired and 311903 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 31.78s, with 3481531 rules fired and 384857 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_219" failed.

State Space Explored:

	693988 states, 4434035 rules fired in 39.90s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
