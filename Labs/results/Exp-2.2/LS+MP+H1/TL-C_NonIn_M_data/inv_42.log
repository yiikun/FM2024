	200000 states explored in 14.43s, with 731792 rules fired and 118987 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 20.16s, with 1099863 rules fired and 179008 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 25.93s, with 1447197 rules fired and 240964 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 32.69s, with 1812650 rules fired and 302607 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 38.48s, with 2187284 rules fired and 362633 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_42" failed.

State Space Explored:

	610459 states, 2226789 rules fired in 39.11s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
