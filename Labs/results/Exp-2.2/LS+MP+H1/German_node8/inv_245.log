	200000 states explored in 9.40s, with 639308 rules fired and 154419 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 12.77s, with 997541 rules fired and 231109 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 16.27s, with 1371287 rules fired and 308381 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 20.40s, with 1811020 rules fired and 378202 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 23.13s, with 2097413 rules fired and 455990 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_245" failed.

State Space Explored:

	688317 states, 2371038 rules fired in 25.48s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
