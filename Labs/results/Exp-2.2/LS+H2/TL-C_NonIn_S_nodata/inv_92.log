	200000 states explored in 20.92s, with 1304268 rules fired and 87645 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 30.85s, with 2038161 rules fired and 123274 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 40.83s, with 2801482 rules fired and 161471 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 51.12s, with 3569304 rules fired and 195258 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 60.32s, with 4277443 rules fired and 241144 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_92" failed.

State Space Explored:

	614658 states, 4375545 rules fired in 61.65s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
