Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 13.79s, with 598302 rules fired and 78847 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 23.02s, with 1279698 rules fired and 151770 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 34.91s, with 2146643 rules fired and 216528 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 45.74s, with 2920205 rules fired and 282358 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 53.76s, with 3488618 rules fired and 358391 states in the queue.

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_217" failed.

State Space Explored:

	575907 states, 3862971 rules fired in 58.83s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
