Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 11.65s, with 671728 rules fired and 76214 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 23.51s, with 1577668 rules fired and 141245 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 30.12s, with 2073974 rules fired and 221546 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_78" failed.

State Space Explored:

	372006 states, 2616947 rules fired in 37.35s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
