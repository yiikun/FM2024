	300000 states explored in 16.20s, with 1407668 rules fired and 236553 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 23.25s, with 2190239 rules fired and 295616 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 26.23s, with 2500499 rules fired and 379660 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 30.07s, with 2916343 rules fired and 459985 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_103" failed.

State Space Explored:

	643427 states, 3132752 rules fired in 32.07s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
