Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 5.72s, with 358002 rules fired and 86248 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 9.73s, with 813670 rules fired and 168647 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 12.82s, with 1157153 rules fired and 254335 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_95" failed.

State Space Explored:

	378451 states, 1392568 rules fired in 14.96s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
