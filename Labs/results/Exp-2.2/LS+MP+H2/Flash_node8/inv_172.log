Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 5.70s, with 364187 rules fired and 86015 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 9.15s, with 757743 rules fired and 170805 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 12.88s, with 1174855 rules fired and 253630 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 15.98s, with 1520191 rules fired and 339824 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_172" failed.

State Space Explored:

	424073 states, 1626171 rules fired in 16.92s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
