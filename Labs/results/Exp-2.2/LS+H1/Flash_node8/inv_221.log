	300000 states explored in 16.73s, with 1103489 rules fired and 247437 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 21.33s, with 1504883 rules fired and 331029 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 26.42s, with 1939171 rules fired and 411889 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 30.62s, with 2305729 rules fired and 495496 states in the queue.

Result:

	Invariant "test_221" failed.

State Space Explored:

	660292 states, 2525982 rules fired in 32.85s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
