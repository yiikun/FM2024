	200000 states explored in 10.87s, with 793717 rules fired and 159881 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 15.65s, with 1282453 rules fired and 235689 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 19.71s, with 1714318 rules fired and 316036 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 23.45s, with 2106156 rules fired and 397544 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 27.16s, with 2494548 rules fired and 479218 states in the queue.

Result:

	Invariant "test_188" failed.

State Space Explored:

	683809 states, 2828556 rules fired in 30.55s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
