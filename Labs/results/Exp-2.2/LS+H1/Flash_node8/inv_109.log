Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 8.11s, with 371720 rules fired and 80658 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 12.96s, with 791078 rules fired and 162037 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 18.75s, with 1279823 rules fired and 239432 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 22.98s, with 1681867 rules fired and 320320 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 27.09s, with 2097936 rules fired and 399400 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_109" failed.

State Space Explored:

	518808 states, 2165839 rules fired in 27.78s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
