	200000 states explored in 12.37s, with 708272 rules fired and 165695 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 17.19s, with 1101178 rules fired and 247613 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 21.48s, with 1479742 rules fired and 330514 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 25.61s, with 1875552 rules fired and 412547 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 30.30s, with 2254814 rules fired and 495335 states in the queue.

Result:

	Invariant "test_237" failed.

State Space Explored:

	601788 states, 2260651 rules fired in 30.37s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
