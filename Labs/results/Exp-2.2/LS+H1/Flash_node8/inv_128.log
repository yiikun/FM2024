	200000 states explored in 13.12s, with 699458 rules fired and 166218 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 18.52s, with 1095866 rules fired and 247793 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 23.99s, with 1506504 rules fired and 329852 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 29.82s, with 1945808 rules fired and 410939 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 35.49s, with 2367180 rules fired and 492044 states in the queue.

Result:

	Invariant "test_128" failed.

State Space Explored:

	645193 states, 2540176 rules fired in 37.92s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
