	200000 states explored in 14.51s, with 806763 rules fired and 159427 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 20.98s, with 1281677 rules fired and 235999 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 26.99s, with 1739270 rules fired and 315074 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 32.40s, with 2145338 rules fired and 396131 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 38.02s, with 2567628 rules fired and 476984 states in the queue.

Result:

	Invariant "test_203" failed.

State Space Explored:

	686968 states, 3007204 rules fired in 44.45s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
