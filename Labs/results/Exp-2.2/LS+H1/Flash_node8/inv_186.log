	200000 states explored in 15.09s, with 910670 rules fired and 156006 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 19.56s, with 1274409 rules fired and 238990 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 25.47s, with 1724844 rules fired and 317331 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 30.98s, with 2105640 rules fired and 399004 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 35.75s, with 2483781 rules fired and 480172 states in the queue.

Result:

	Invariant "test_186" failed.

State Space Explored:

	622905 states, 2568232 rules fired in 36.55s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
