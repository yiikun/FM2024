	200000 states explored in 14.27s, with 848191 rules fired and 156988 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 19.58s, with 1269491 rules fired and 236476 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 25.50s, with 1754069 rules fired and 314876 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 30.69s, with 2162697 rules fired and 395439 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 36.89s, with 2651287 rules fired and 471885 states in the queue.

Result:

	Invariant "test_35" failed.

State Space Explored:

	648409 states, 2861466 rules fired in 39.51s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
