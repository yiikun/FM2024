	200000 states explored in 15.34s, with 809602 rules fired and 159156 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 20.91s, with 1188967 rules fired and 240811 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 27.18s, with 1620077 rules fired and 320531 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 33.72s, with 2064801 rules fired and 399161 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 40.08s, with 2502111 rules fired and 478734 states in the queue.

Result:

	Invariant "test_85" failed.

State Space Explored:

	664534 states, 2780781 rules fired in 44.20s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
