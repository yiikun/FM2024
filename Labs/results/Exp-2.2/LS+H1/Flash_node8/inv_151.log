Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 7.76s, with 344468 rules fired and 82697 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 12.32s, with 726733 rules fired and 165044 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 17.01s, with 1131948 rules fired and 246178 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 21.92s, with 1541651 rules fired and 326171 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_151" failed.

State Space Explored:

	478608 states, 1862223 rules fired in 25.61s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
