Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 8.47s, with 350450 rules fired and 82902 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 13.60s, with 697342 rules fired and 165458 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_259" failed.

State Space Explored:

	243983 states, 855393 rules fired in 15.86s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
