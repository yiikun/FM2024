Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 8.90s, with 350490 rules fired and 82778 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 15.56s, with 757340 rules fired and 163763 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 22.10s, with 1167703 rules fired and 244268 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 29.04s, with 1606835 rules fired and 323434 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 35.71s, with 2038540 rules fired and 404034 states in the queue.

Result:

	Invariant "test_251" failed.

State Space Explored:

	543317 states, 2230844 rules fired in 38.73s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
