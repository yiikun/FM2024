	200000 states explored in 14.41s, with 803163 rules fired and 159587 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 19.64s, with 1191394 rules fired and 240956 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 25.10s, with 1611376 rules fired and 322462 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 31.39s, with 2092444 rules fired and 400935 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 37.41s, with 2548661 rules fired and 480420 states in the queue.

Result:

	Invariant "test_96" failed.

State Space Explored:

	694603 states, 2972467 rules fired in 43.24s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
