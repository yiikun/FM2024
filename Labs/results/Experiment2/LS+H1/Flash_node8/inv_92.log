	200000 states explored in 15.28s, with 808272 rules fired and 159309 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 20.76s, with 1182823 rules fired and 241132 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 27.30s, with 1636538 rules fired and 320559 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 33.96s, with 2102089 rules fired and 399283 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 40.11s, with 2529668 rules fired and 479514 states in the queue.

Result:

	Invariant "test_92" failed.

State Space Explored:

	636161 states, 2668949 rules fired in 42.16s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
