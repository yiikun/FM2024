Result:

	Invariant "test_161" failed.

State Space Explored:

	2544957 states, 14104372 rules fired in 219.05s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
