Progress Report:

	100000 states explored in 12.70s, with 634259 rules fired and 45579 states in the queue.
	200000 states explored in 22.57s, with 1299775 rules fired and 87473 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 33.53s, with 2036636 rules fired and 122984 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 44.33s, with 2781460 rules fired and 163144 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 55.80s, with 3549632 rules fired and 197769 states in the queue.

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_88" failed.

State Space Explored:

	592706 states, 4208063 rules fired in 65.29s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
