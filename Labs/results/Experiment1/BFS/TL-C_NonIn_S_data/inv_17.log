Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0
Finite-state Concurrent System Verifier.

Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 is based on various versions of Murphi.
Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 :
Copyright (C) 2009-2012 by Sapienza University of Rome.
Murphi release 3.1 :
Copyright (C) 1992 - 1999 by the Board of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior University.

==========================================================================

Protocol: ./protocols/exec/TL-C_NonIn_S_data/TL-C_NonIn_S_data_inv17

Algorithm:
	Verification by breadth first search.
	with symmetry algorithm 3 -- Heuristic Small Memory Normalization
	with permutation trial limit 10.

Memory usage:

	* The size of each state is 1920 bits (rounded up to 240 bytes).
	* The memory allocated for the hash table and state queue is
	  10485 Mbytes.
	  With two words of overhead per state, the maximum size of
	  the state space is 38437547 states.
	   * Use option "-k" or "-m" to increase this, if necessary.
	* Capacity in queue for breadth-first search: 3843754 states.
	   * Change the constant gPercentActiveStates in mu_prolog.inc
	     to increase this, if necessary.

Warning: No trace will not be printed in the case of protocol errors!
         Check the options if you want to have error traces.

	200000 states explored in 7.53s, with 883116 rules fired and 76297 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 9.82s, with 1331335 rules fired and 110576 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 12.09s, with 1767445 rules fired and 144418 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 13.67s, with 2226869 rules fired and 178226 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 15.80s, with 2660148 rules fired and 214366 states in the queue.
	700000 states explored in 18.07s, with 3118609 rules fired and 249000 states in the queue.
	800000 states explored in 20.29s, with 3578572 rules fired and 285265 states in the queue.
	900000 states explored in 22.54s, with 4026199 rules fired and 320314 states in the queue.
	1000000 states explored in 24.78s, with 4471444 rules fired and 355820 states in the queue.
	1100000 states explored in 27.07s, with 4955047 rules fired and 390992 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_17" failed.

State Space Explored:

	1119648 states, 5059627 rules fired in 27.50s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
