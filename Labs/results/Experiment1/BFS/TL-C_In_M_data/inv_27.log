Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0
Finite-state Concurrent System Verifier.

Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 is based on various versions of Murphi.
Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 :
Copyright (C) 2009-2012 by Sapienza University of Rome.
Murphi release 3.1 :
Copyright (C) 1992 - 1999 by the Board of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior University.

==========================================================================

Protocol: ./protocols/exec/TL-C_In_M_data/TL-C_In_M_data_inv27

Algorithm:
	Verification by breadth first search.
	with symmetry algorithm 3 -- Heuristic Small Memory Normalization
	with permutation trial limit 10.

Memory usage:

	* The size of each state is 3032 bits (rounded up to 384 bytes).
	* The memory allocated for the hash table and state queue is
	  10485 Mbytes.
	  With two words of overhead per state, the maximum size of
	  the state space is 25157789 states.
	   * Use option "-k" or "-m" to increase this, if necessary.
	* Capacity in queue for breadth-first search: 2515778 states.
	   * Change the constant gPercentActiveStates in mu_prolog.inc
	     to increase this, if necessary.

Warning: No trace will not be printed in the case of protocol errors!
         Check the options if you want to have error traces.

	1000000 states explored in 112.95s, with 10391803 rules fired and 493519 states in the queue.
	1100000 states explored in 122.53s, with 11530295 rules fired and 552594 states in the queue.
	1200000 states explored in 132.30s, with 12779494 rules fired and 610610 states in the queue.
	1300000 states explored in 142.24s, with 14171653 rules fired and 668169 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_27" failed.

State Space Explored:

	1342389 states, 14848178 rules fired in 146.65s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
