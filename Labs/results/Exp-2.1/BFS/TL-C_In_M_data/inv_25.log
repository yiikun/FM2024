Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0
Finite-state Concurrent System Verifier.

Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 is based on various versions of Murphi.
Caching Murphi Release 5.5.0 :
Copyright (C) 2009-2012 by Sapienza University of Rome.
Murphi release 3.1 :
Copyright (C) 1992 - 1999 by the Board of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior University.

==========================================================================

Protocol: ./protocols/exec/TL-C_In_M_data/TL-C_In_M_data_inv25

Algorithm:
	Verification by breadth first search.
	with symmetry algorithm 3 -- Heuristic Small Memory Normalization
	with permutation trial limit 10.

Memory usage:

	* The size of each state is 3032 bits (rounded up to 384 bytes).
	* The memory allocated for the hash table and state queue is
	  10485 Mbytes.
	  With two words of overhead per state, the maximum size of
	  the state space is 25157789 states.
	   * Use option "-k" or "-m" to increase this, if necessary.
	* Capacity in queue for breadth-first search: 2515778 states.
	   * Change the constant gPercentActiveStates in mu_prolog.inc
	     to increase this, if necessary.

Warning: No trace will not be printed in the case of protocol errors!
         Check the options if you want to have error traces.

	1000000 states explored in 114.25s, with 10391803 rules fired and 493519 states in the queue.
	1100000 states explored in 124.12s, with 11530295 rules fired and 552594 states in the queue.
	1200000 states explored in 133.56s, with 12779494 rules fired and 610610 states in the queue.
	1300000 states explored in 143.13s, with 14171653 rules fired and 668169 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_25" failed.

State Space Explored:

	1306444 states, 14284087 rules fired in 143.78s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
