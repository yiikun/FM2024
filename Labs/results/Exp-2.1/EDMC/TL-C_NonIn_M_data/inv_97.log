	200000 states explored in 7.00s, with 686272 rules fired and 153365 states in the queue.
	300000 states explored in 10.27s, with 1160616 rules fired and 218822 states in the queue.
	400000 states explored in 13.82s, with 1682933 rules fired and 281334 states in the queue.
	500000 states explored in 15.51s, with 1924702 rules fired and 362493 states in the queue.
	600000 states explored in 17.26s, with 2177757 rules fired and 443677 states in the queue.

==========================================================================

Result:

	Invariant "test_reachable_state_97" failed.

State Space Explored:

	678315 states, 2411263 rules fired in 18.91s.

Analysis of State Space:

	There are rules that are never fired.
	If you are running with symmetry, this may be why.  Otherwise,
	please run this program with "-pr" for the rules information.
